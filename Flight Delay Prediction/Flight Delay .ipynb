    "## Initial Focus \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to help the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predict the flight delays to help them effectively manage the air traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for coordinating the complex web of more than 40,000 flights a day over the U.S. Shortly after 7 a.m. ET, there were already 3,500 flights in the air. During peak travel periods, that figure can climb to more than 5,000 flights at once. The FAA recently released a statement claiming it was responsible for less than half of airline delays this year in the US. The announcement came after United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby accused the FAA of being the number one cause of flight delays in the US this year.  In the report, the administration cited statistics from January to May of this year. In these five months, it claims the airlines were responsible for twice as many minutes of flight delays as it was. Flight delays have become a regular enough occurrence that passengers now plan all trips with extra time to account for these delays. The high percentage of flight delays is the result of multiple factors. In addition to the shortages faced by airlines, the FAA has also struggled to keep up with current air travel. The FAA wants to get a hold on the flight delays, and manage the air traffic more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of flight delays depends on a lot of fcators like the travel time, origin, destination, carrier etc. Here are the list of features that can be used to predict whether an employee is able to complete the task at hand or not.\n",

    "> In Logistic Regression, the ideal choice would be to go with the probability threshold of 0.40. It tries to keep the False Positive and the False Negative rate at bay. We can't have a higher value in any of these. The model still functions better then the K-1 but does not seem to be performing well here overall, The F-1 score is also Low here at 0.41."

The model with the highest AUC will also help in considering which is as a better fit model."

The availability of ground staff might also be an issue, since the flight was not expected to land any time soon the Aircraft Marshallers might be occupied in other work. So could be the issue with the safety measures in place.\n",

It elegantly sums up the predictive performance of a model by combining two otherwise competing metrics — precision and recall. It is possible that for our use-case the errors caused by FPs and FNs are (almost) equally undesirable. Hence, you may wish for a model to have as few FPs and FNs as possible. Put differently, you would want to maximise both precision and recall. In practice, it is not possible to maximise both precision and recall at the same time because of the trade-off between precision and recall. By definition, F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines precision and recall into a single number using the following formula:\n",

The higher the value of F-1 score the better our model performs. A F-1 score of 0.11 is considered to be a very low score. We need to look for better models. \n",
