    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Work allocation is the process of effectively organizing resources and labor to meet the company's output goals of a task or project. The allocation is based on how the business will benefit from appropriately assigning resources and roles. Management can start by assessing the project's requirements in terms of the required skillset. This would be based on the employee's abilities, qualifications and experience, with each task being allocated to the best person for the role. The assigned staff member should be able to deliver on the requirements. The employees have gone through several tranings in the past, which is inluded in the dataset. On the basis of which employee can complete a particular task, they will be alocated to several teams to effectively manage the workload.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The work allocation process depends on a lot of factors like the experience of the employee or the level of training they have had during their duration. Here are the list of features that can be used to predict whether an employee is able to complete the task at hand or not.\n",

As once the employees are assigned to a team with the responsibility of finishing a particular task, and if they are not able to finish it. It's going to hamper team's efficiency and work load. So, for efficiently manage the workload management of the team, we need to ensure the False Positives are at the minimum. \n",

    "After careful consideration of multiple probability threshold options and the corresponding speculated risks/costs. Probabilty Threshold of **0.50** seems to be the ideal choice here. At 0.50 threshold, the False Positive rate is at 0%, which is ideal for our business case. There is 0% probability that an employee won't be able to finish the task at hand, provided the model predicts that they will be able to.The Model is predicting at a precision of 100%, and has a accuracy of 90%. Our model is 100% precise in predicting the positives out of all the actual positives. Here, the False Positive Rate is also at bay i.e. at 50% which won't impact our business much negatively.This is by far the best performane across all the probability thresholds.\n",
