    "## Initial Focus \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to create a loan prediction model for the Underwriting Team of The Regional Bank of America.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Underwriting is the process of evaluating the risk involved with a financial transaction, such as a bank loan. Manual underwriting processes are inconsistent, lack accuracy, and are time-consuming. Automating your loan process can streamline the work that needs to be completed, offering an accurate and consistent data flow for every step of your loan process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated underwriting is a technology-driven underwriting process that provides a computer generated loan decision. The lending industry is broadly migrating to the use of new technology-driven loan underwriting platforms to improve the processing time for all types of loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of loan approvals depends on a lot of factors like the credit score, age of the customer, delinquent history, income etc. Here are the list of features that can be used to predict whether a loan for an individual could be approved or not. \n",

The Precision also turns out to be good (0.92), and same goes for the accuracy as well which comes out to be 79%. We should also keep recall in mind as well as we do not want to deny loan to the people who are actually eligible. This would minimize the profit to the bank. So, keeping all the factors in mind. a threshold of 0.60 seems to be the ideal choice."

    "In this problem we are looking to minimize the **False Positives**, We don't want to falsly predict that a person will not default on the loan, when there are good chance that they will. There is a lot of hassle to get back the loan amount, there is alot of cost associated with it as well. If the lender considers a debt in default, the loan may be turned over to a collection agency(The cost to which has to be beared by the bank initially). If the collection agency is unsuccessful in securing a loan repayment, the agency can take the matter to court(costs of legal team) and pursue avenues like garnishing wages or putting a lien on a borrower’s home. When a person defaults, the bank has to put in a lot of money to get the loan amount back, plus the moeny is stuck for that period of time.\n",

    "The **False Positive Rate** is calculated as FP/FP+TN, where FP is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives (FP+TN being the total number of negatives). It’s the probability that a false alarm will be raised: that a positive result will be given when the true value is negative.\n",
